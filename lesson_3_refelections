When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
we choose to use a remote repository when there is more than one memeber developping the project esspeacilly 
if these memebres are located in diffrent places, it is also a good practice to keep a backup version to remote place
#these line is to make changes in both side a remote and the local
